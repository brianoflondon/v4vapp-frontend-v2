# Current fees
## <date_time_now_utc>

These are the current fees charged by the @V4VApp when swapping Hive or HBD into or Lightning. All fees are converted from Sats to Hive/HBD using live rates from @coingecko's [API](https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/simple/price?ids=bitcoin,hive,hive_dollar&vs_currencies=btc,usd,eur,aud&include_market_cap=true&include_24hr_vol=true&include_24hr_change=true&include_last_updated_at=true)

Notes:
- Fees are only chanrged when converting Hive/HBD into sats or vice versa.
- Depositing Sats and Paying With Sats (***PayWithSats*** and  ***KeepSats*** ) will not have significant fees (there is a 0.001 Hive fee for notifications)
- Example: if sats are sent to the Lightning Address `yourhivename@sats.v4v.app` they will be held as ***KeepSats*** on [v4v.app](https://v4v.app). You can use these sats to pay for a Lightning invoice without being charged a conversion fee.
- Example: if sats are sent to `yourhivename@v4v.app` you will receive `Hive` after a fee is deducted. If they are sent to `yourhivename@hbd.v4v.app` you will receive `HBD` again after a fee.
- Converting a sats balance held as ***KeepSats*** on [v4v.app](https://v4v.app) to Hive/HBD will carry a fee.
- Rates are taken from publicly available rate api's as close to the transaction time as possible.

This services is offered as an experiemental service: if you have any issues using it the utmost efforts will be made to make you happy.
